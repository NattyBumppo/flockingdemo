# Summary

This is a simple demo of the "boids" flocking algorithm, as developed by Craig Reynolds. This project requires the Python SDL2 library to be installed.

# Credits

This application was programmed by [Nat Guy](http://www.natguy.net). I also reappropriated the Brensenham line algorithm implementation used in [this project](https://gist.github.com/arti95/6264890).
